## About

![JaxCore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80020581/144406208-38b04189-d291-4c8b-8a3f-4b43236b1ce5.png)

JaxCore is a collection of utility modules designed to improve your desktop experience and increase your productivity. Core is a configuration hub that allows for quick access to settings, updates, and new releases.
Also, JaxCore is an absolute must-have, and here's why:

### Interactive Modules

Tired of scribbling notes on a notepad? Dislike the appearance of your cluttered desktop? Want to get rid of those annoying shortcuts? Core has got you covered. All of the aforementioned feats are easily accomplished with Core's elementary modules.

### Easy configuration

Core makes customization easier for new users by providing a dedicated configuration menu for each skin, eliminating the need for the user to modify the code or write their own.

### Update Checker

The built-in update checker in Core will ensure that you never miss out on new features or bug fixes. Core can also notify you when new skin updates are available for the skins you have installed. You can install all of the updates with a single button press, and Core will handle the rest.

## Getting Started

A quick guide to installing and configuring JaxCore. 

### Prerequisites

- [Rainmeter v4.5](https://www.rainmeter.net/) or newer. Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file from [Rainmeter's official website](https://www.rainmeter.net/).

### Installation 

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter, you can now proceed to install JaxCore by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **Core** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **JaxCore**.
2. Finally, proceed through the welcome screen to complete the installation.

> Note: Refer to [JaxCore's Documentation](https://jaxcore.gitbook.io/core/) for the **Uninstallation** guide.

### Customization

JaxCore comes with 7 different appearance presets, **Normal, GoldenInsider, Frosted, Light(just why), Amoled, Classic and Enchantment**. Follow the steps outlined below to choose a custom appearance preset:

1. Open Core and navigate to the **Settings** page, then to the **Appearance** tab.
2. Under **Presets and style** change the appearance preset to the one you like.
    > **The option is named as "Core appearance preset".** For reference, see the image below. 
    >  <img src ="https://imgur.com/mBz9C8t.png" alt = "ref" width="737" height ="70">

And that's it! The color scheme will be changed instantly after you select a new preset.

> Note: The **Appearance** tab allows you to further customize each preset as required.

### Miscellaneous Setup

#### Global Variables:

Global variables are shared settings that are used by the majority of Core modules and widgets, so it is recommended that you configure these properly after installing JaxCore. To do so, follow the steps outlined below.

1. Open Core and navigate to the **Settings** page, then to the **Global** tab.
2. Under **Time & Weather** configure the **Time Format**, **Weather Temperature Unit**, **Weather Location**, and **Weather Language** options according to you personal preference.

> Note: The **Weather** and the **Time** will be displayed by the modules/widgets based on your configuration, so make sure you configure the global variables correctly.**

#### Addons:

Addons are third-party toolsprogramsextensions that are required by certain modules and widgets to retrieve song information or to provide additional appearance features such as shadows and widget-blur. JaxCore modules and widgets currently require two addons to function properly: **[Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/)** and **[Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)**. Refer to the installation guides linked below to install the aforementioned addons.

* [Spicetify Installation Guide](https://github.com/Jax-Core/ModularPlayers#installing-spicetify)
* [Image Magick Installation Guide](https://github.com/Jax-Core/ModularPlayers#installing-imagemagick)

#### Language:

Core still has the functionality to switch to a desired language. To do so, follow the steps outlined below.

1. Open Core and navigate to the **Settings** page, then to the **Language** tab.
2. Under **Other Languages** choose a language you would like Core to be displayed in.
3. Once the confirmation pop-up appears, click **Start** and wait for Core to translate. 

Following the completion of the translation process, you should be able to access Core in the language you previously selected.

> Note: Because this feature is still in beta, bugs are to be expected. If you come across one, please report it via the Core Community Discord Server.
